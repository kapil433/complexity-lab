# Complexity Lab

A personal research lab for studying **India's passenger-vehicle market as a complex system**,
built on VAHAN registration data (2012–2026, state × month × OEM × fuel) enriched with
state-level covariates — per-capita income, urbanization, CNG/EV infrastructure, state fuel
prices, road tax, policy events, population — and a proprietary wholesale dispatch dataset
(city × model × month, local only).

**Live lab notebook**: [kapil433.github.io/complexity-lab](https://kapil433.github.io/complexity-lab/) —
13 experiments with full methodological cards, light/dark theme.

| Layer | Where | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| Descriptive | `analysis/descriptive`, Market Pulse | Size, growth, shares, concentration, seasonality |
| Distributions | `analysis/distributions` | Power laws, rank–size, Gini |
| Econometrics | `analysis/econometrics` | Panel FE regression, Granger, changepoints, DiD with placebos |
| Forecasting | `analysis/forecast`, `analysis/nowcast` | Backtested SARIMA/Holt-Winters/naive; wholesale→retail nowcast |
| Networks | `networks/` | Bipartite OEM–state graphs, contagion, network inference + nulls |
| Complexity | `complexity/` | HMM fuel regimes, early-warning signals, tipping points, survival |
| Simulation | `simulation/` | Bass diffusion & counterfactuals, ABM, demand/supply shock model |

## Quickstart

```powershell
uv sync --all-extras           # environment
uv run lab ingest              # raw bundle + reference CSVs -> data/lab.duckdb
uv run lab panel               # state x month / state x year analysis panels
uv run lab wholesale           # local-only proprietary dispatches (optional)
uv run lab list                # registered experiments
uv run lab run descriptive-baseline
uv run lab app                 # interactive lab -> http://localhost:8501
```

## Deployment

The public research notebook is deployed to GitHub Pages by
`.github/workflows/site.yml`. The interactive Streamlit app is defined by
[`render.yaml`](render.yaml); it rebuilds DuckDB from committed Vahan and reference
inputs when the service starts. Proprietary wholesale files are intentionally not
deployed, and the Wholesale page reports that limitation instead of substituting
modeled data.

## The interactive lab (10 specialist pages)

Home is a context-aware **Market Brief**. Its year, state, fuel, and OEM filters
persist across navigation and in shareable URLs; every page displays evidence type,
data cutoff, limitations, provenance, and downloadable view context. Views can be
saved to the local research library.

Market Pulse · Compare and Explore · Network Lab · Diffusion Lab · Causal Lab ·
Wholesale and Channel · Transitions and Regimes · Forecast Studio · Scenario and
Shock Lab · Reference Lab. Light/dark via app menu → Settings.

Every analytical page opens with an explainer card (question, method, plain-English concepts,
math with toy examples, interpretation guide, limits) — same content as the site's
[experiment guide](https://kapil433.github.io/complexity-lab/experiments/guide.html).

## Experiments (the published notebook)

001 descriptive baseline · 002 EV diffusion (Bass) · 003 OEM–state network ·
004 wholesale↔retail nowcast · 005 phase transitions · 006 EV tipping points ·
007 EV contagion (Moran's I + threshold cascades) · 008 HMM fuel regimes ·
009 adoption-network horse race (+ out-of-sample + rewiring null) ·
010 SHEV structural isolation (lead paper) · 011 regime-switch survival ·
012 hatchback→SUV transition (τ\* ≈ 30%) · 013 SHEV tax-parity counterfactual.

Add your own: copy `experiments/_template.qmd`, number it, commit — CI renders it
into the site. Conventions in [docs/lab-guide.md](docs/lab-guide.md).

## Engineering

- **Validation in CI**: `scripts/validate_numbers.py` runs on every push — internal
  identities (shares sum to 1, panel == raw totals) plus external anchors (FADA-scale
  totals, public EV share, Maruti share, wholesale↔retail agreement).
- **Reproducibility**: DuckDB is a build artifact; everything rebuilds from the
  committed bundle + reference CSVs. `_freeze/` carries locally-executed notebook
  results so CI can publish wholesale-dependent experiments without the data.
- **Experiment data contract**: all registered experiments declare dependencies;
  reference-aware analyses use `experiment_state_year`,
  `experiment_state_context`, or the canonical policy timeline. Superseded
  reference tables and placeholder observations are not loaded.
- **Data refresh**: monthly ritual in [docs/refresh-runbook.md](docs/refresh-runbook.md).
- 70+ tests; ruff; experiment registry with timestamped, manifest-ed artifacts.

## Data, licensing, caveats

- Registration data: **Vahan Intelligence** ([vahanintelligence.in](https://www.vahanintelligence.in)),
  based on VAHAN/Parivahan public data (MoRTH, GoI) — research use with attribution.
- Reference CSVs carry per-file provenance (`source`, `quality` columns); read
  [DATA_TRUTH.md](DATA_TRUTH.md) **before inferring** — it is the verified governing
  contract for coverage, joins, mapping, limitations and safe claims. The compact
  table-level reference remains in [docs/data-dictionary.md](docs/data-dictionary.md);
  `uv run lab references` prints what is usable, constrained, or unavailable.
- The wholesale dataset is proprietary: raw and derived files are gitignored; only
  aggregate chart outputs appear in published experiments.
- Code: MIT ([LICENSE](LICENSE)).
